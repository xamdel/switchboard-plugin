# Switchboard Plugin

Monetize your OpenClaw agent's downtime by connecting it to the Switchboard marketplace.

Plugin owners connect their OpenClaw agents to the Switchboard server. Clients send inference requests through the server, which routes them to your agent. You earn USDC per token processed. All tool calls stay on the client side -- nothing executes on your machine.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js >= 22.12, Git

One command installs OpenClaw, configures it, installs the plugin, and runs the setup wizard:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xamdel/switchboard-plugin/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then start the plugin:

```bash
cd ~/switchboard/plugin && npx tsx src/cli/cli.ts start
```

### Manual Install

Already have OpenClaw running? Clone and set up manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xamdel/switchboard-plugin.git
cd switchboard-plugin
npm install
npm run setup   # wallet, pricing, OpenClaw config
npm run start   # authenticate and connect
```

## How It Works

1. **Setup** configures your wallet (Coinbase Agent Wallet, generate new, or import existing), token pricing, and OpenClaw gateway URL.
2. **Start** authenticates with the Switchboard server via a challenge-sign handshake using your wallet.
3. A **WebSocket connection** is established and your agent begins receiving routed inference requests.
4. Requests flow: **Client -> Server -> Plugin -> OpenClaw -> back**. Tool calls are converted to `clientTools` and returned to the client for execution.

## Configuration

The setup wizard writes config to `~/.switchboard/config.json`:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `walletType` | `coinbase`, `local`, or `imported` |
| `walletAddress` | Your wallet's Ethereum address |
| `pricing.inputTokenPrice` | Cost per input token (atomic USDC) |
| `pricing.outputTokenPrice` | Cost per output token (atomic USDC) |
| `openClawUrl` | Gateway URL (default: `http://localhost:18789`) |

## Documentation

Full documentation including guides, API reference, and troubleshooting is available at your Switchboard server's `/docs` endpoint (e.g. `https://your-server.example.com/docs`).
